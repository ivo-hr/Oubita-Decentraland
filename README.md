# Oubita Decentraland
 
My task during my stay at Oubita was to develop and market their presence in the Decentraland metaverse.


Seeing now the recent developments regarding web3, crypto and the metaverse I wish this work to be regarded only technically rather than for what it was used.

After doing reserch and forming my ideas, I hold a firm opinion that the way the beforementioned elements were used for the past years have been a total and utter waste of time and resources and has actively changed our world for worse. 

The potential is there for it to become something useful, that can give power to the people and further our technological advancements, but the way it has been heading since it's inception isn't it.
